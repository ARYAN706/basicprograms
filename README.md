| Program No.| Question |
| ------- | ------ |
| Program-01 | Program to print pattern |
| Program-02 | Program to check whether the given number is prime or not |
| Program-03 | Program to find largest of three number using simple if condition|
| Program-04 | Program to find largest of three number using if-else condition |
| Program-05 | Program to find largest of three number using nested if condition |
| Program-06 | Implement using  functions  to  check  whether  the  given  number  is prime  and  display appropriate messages. (No built-in math function)|
| Program-07 | Develop a program to introduce 2D Array manipulation and implement Matrix multiplication and ensure the rules of multiplication are checked.|
| Program-08 |Develop a Program to compute Sin(x) using Taylor Series approximation. Compare your result with the built-in Library function. Print both the results with appropriate messages. |
| Program-09 | Write functions to implement string operations such as compare, concatenate, string length. Convince the parameter passing techniques. |
| Program-10| Develop a program to sort the given set of N numbers using Bubble sort.|
| Program-11 | Develop a program to find the square root of a given number N and execute foe all possible inputs with appropriate messages. Note: Donâ€™t use library function sqrt(n). |
| Program-12 Implement structures to read, write and compute average marks and the students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students. |
| Program-13 | Develop a program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of n real numbers. |
| Program-14 | Implement recursive functions for Binary to Decimal Conversion. |
