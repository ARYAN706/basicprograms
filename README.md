# C-basicprograms
## This repo contains basics programs in c programming language.
| Program No.| Question |
| ------- | ------ |
| Program-01 | Develop a program to solve simple computational problems using arithmetic expressions and use of each operator leading to simulation of a Commercial calculator.(No built-in math function) |
| Program-02 | Develop a program to compute the roots of a quadratic equation by accepting the coefficients. Print appropriate messages. |
| Program-03 | Develop a program to find the reverse of a positive integer and check for palindrome or  not. Display appropriate messages.|
| Program-04 | An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit: for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit: beyond 300 units Rs 1 per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs.400,  then an additional surcharge of 15% of total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of the user, number of units consumed and print out the charges. |
| Program-05 | Introduce 1D Array manipulation and implement Binary search. |
| Program-06 | Implement using  functions  to  check  whether  the  given  number  is prime  and  display appropriate messages. (No built-in math function)|
| Program-07 | Develop a program to introduce 2D Array manipulation and implement Matrix multiplication and ensure the rules of multiplication are checked.|
| Program-08 |Develop a Program to compute Sin(x) using Taylor Series approximation. Compare your result with the built-in Library function. Print both the results with appropriate messages. |
| Program-09 | Write functions to implement string operations such as compare, concatenate, string length. Convince the parameter passing techniques. |
| Program-10| Develop a program to sort the given set of N numbers using Bubble sort.|
| Program-11 | Develop a program to find the square root of a given number N and execute foe all possible inputs with appropriate messages. Note: Donâ€™t use library function sqrt(n). |
| Program-12 | Implement structures to read, write and compute average marks and the students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students. |
| Program-13 | Develop a program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of n real numbers. |
| Program-14 | Implement recursive functions for Binary to Decimal Conversion. |
